critical:

- UI coords for buttons

- UI visibility can only support one plugin per group now?
	- think about some alternatives for structuring this
	- what does this mean?

- profile the game

- what if save/game data doesn't exist?

- testing!

- back to editor mode to make sure everything works there too

---

nice to have:

- player movement
	- mouse controls

- add sound/effect for bullets hitting (feedback)?

- editor delete sprite is too big
- editor could have 'delete all' button (create new)
- editor button size doesn't seem to match logic

---

- engine: why is scene in UI folder?
